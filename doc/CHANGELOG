Suggestions from 2003-11-26:
	Math font is still too small, parts missing. This is harder to change than it seems.
Changes from 2003-11-26:
	Added EEG to brain section as well as brain picture to sources.
	picture of CMB distribution over universe viewed from earth (WMAP).
	EMR description moved to top, and photon image added.
	Add 802.1 Wireless-LAN transmission frequency
	Title font changed to san serif (cmssbx10) not cmbx10
	Add other cell phone ranges (FDMA, TDMA, CDMA)
	Middle C should have a white outline
	Put ticks onto band division labels (under 2GHz, etc)
