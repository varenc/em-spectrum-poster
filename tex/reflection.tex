Microwaves, which have a large wavelength compared to visible light, will bounce off metal mesh in a microwave oven whereas visible light will pass through.\end{itemize}\begin{tabular}{cl}%Mirror\begin{minipage}[b]{1.8in}\rput(0.97,.3){\input{pictures/reflection.tex}}\end{minipage}&\hspace{0.0in}\begin{minipage}[b]{1.8in}	\textcolor{white}{EMR of any wavelength can be reflected, however,	the reflectivity of a material depends on many factors including	the wavelength of the incident beam.\vspace{3pt}\\	The angle of incidence ($\theta_i$) and angle of reflection ($\theta_r$) are the same.}\end{minipage}\\\end{tabular}}
