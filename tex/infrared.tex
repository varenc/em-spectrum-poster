{\Large Infrared Radiation}
\begin{itemize}

\item Infrared radiation (IR) is sensed by humans as heat and is below the range of human vision. Humans (and anything at room temperature) are emitters of IR.

\item IR remote control signals are invisible to the human eye but can be detected by most camcorders.

\item Night vision scopes/goggles use a special camera that senses IR and converts the image to visible light. Some IR cameras employ an IR lamp to help illuminate the view.

\item IR LASERs are used for burning objects.

\item A demonstration of IR is to hold a metal bowl in front of your face. The IR emitted by your body  will be reflected back using the parabolic shape of the bowl and you will feel the heat.

\item Fiber-optic based infrared communication signals are sometimes amplified with Erbium-Doped Fiber Amplifiers  \scalebox{.8}{\psframebox[linestyle=none]{\fiberoptics{0.13,-.13}{EDFA}}}
