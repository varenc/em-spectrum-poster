{\Large Brain Waves}
\begin{itemize}
\item By connecting electrodes from the human head to an electroencephalograph (EEG), it is possible to measure very small cyclic electrical signals.
\item There has been much study on this topic, but like all effects on humans, the findings are not as sound as the science of materials.
\item Generally, lower brain wave frequencies relate to sleep, and the higher frequencies relate to alertness.
\item Devices have been made for measuring and stimulating brain waves to achieve a desired state.
\end{itemize}
