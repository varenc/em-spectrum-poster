{\Large LASER}
\begin{itemize}

\item LASER is an acronym for {\bfseries L}ight {\bfseries A}mplification by {\bfseries S}timulated {\bfseries E}mission of {\bfseries R}adiation.
\item A LASER is a device that produces monochromatic EMR of high intensity.
\item With proper equipment, any EMR can be made to operate like a LASER. For example, microwaves are used to create a MASER.

%\item Junk/reword: Photons can be brought together and the resultant sum of forces is seen. If the polarization and phase are the same for the photons the the resultant light appears to be amplified. Some LASERs achieve this by constantly pumping photons into a filter to get the same frequency then bouncing those filtered photons off opposing mirrors to get the phase and polarization just right. Once the light has been ``amplified" enough it will escape from one of the mirrors.
