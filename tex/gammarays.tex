{\Large Gamma Rays}
\begin{itemize}

\item Gamma radiation is the highest energy radiation (up to $\approx 10^{20}$ eV) that has been measured. At this energy, the radiation could be from gamma-rays, protons, electrons, or something else.

\item Alpha, beta, and delta radiation are not electromagnetic but are actually parts of the atom being released from a radioactive element. In some cases this can cause gamma radiation. These are not to be confused with brain waves of similar names.

\end{itemize}
