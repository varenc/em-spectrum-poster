\begin{itemize}

\item Although sound, ocean waves, and heartbeats are not electromagnetic, they are included on this chart as a frequency reference. Other properties of electromagnetic waves are different from sound waves.

\item Sound waves are caused by an oscillating compression of molecules. Sound cannot travel in a vacuum such as outer space.

\item The speed of sound in air at sea level is 1240kph (770mph).

\item Humans can only hear sound between $\approx$20Hz to $\approx$20kHz.

\item Infrasound (below 20Hz) can be sensed by internal organs and touch.

Frequencies in the 0.2Hz range are often the cause of motion sickness.

\item Bats can hear sound up to $\approx$50kHz.

\item The 88 piano keys of the Equal Temperament scale are accurately located on the frequency chart.

\item Over the ages people have striven to divide the continuous audio frequency spectrum into individual musical notes that have harmonious relationships. Microtonal musicians study various scales. One recent count lists 4700 different musical scales.

\item The musical note A is depicted on the chart as \pscirclebox[fillstyle=solid,fillcolor=HumanAudioColor]{\textcolor{white}{A}}
