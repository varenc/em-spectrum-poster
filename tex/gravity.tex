{\Large Gravitational Waves}

\begin{itemize}

\item Gravity is the mysterious force that holds large objects together and binds our planets, stars, and galaxies together. Many people have unsuccessfully theorized about the details of gravity and its relationship to other forces. There have been no links between gravity waves and electromagnetic radiation.

\item Gravity is theorized to warp space and time. In fact, gravity is responsible for bending light as observed by the gravity-lens example of distant galaxies.

\item ``Gravitational waves" would appear as ripples in space-time formed by large objects moving through space that might possibly be detected in the future by very sensitive instruments.

\item The speed that gravity propagates through space has not yet been been determined.
